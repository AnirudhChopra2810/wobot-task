# wobot-task

It was a fun to do this task although its not perfect but it is near the requirements.

1. Please make sure to add a config file in the server folder containing following options:
DATABASE =  ,
DATABASE_PASSWORD =  ,
JWT_SECRET =  ,
JWT_EXPIRES_IN =  ,

Make sure that after "=" their is no quotes, everything is written without single or double quotes.

2. All the url's  are locally and manually set so please run the server on local machine.
3. Everything is done as per the requirement, only one thing is lacking ie. the response that user is getting to know about his/her products is viewed on console.
I was unable to display it on screen because i was running out of time.

Hopefully, you will find me the fit for the job and I really enjoyed doing this task.
